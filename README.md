With our recent flatbed script release, a lot of requests were made to make a towing script as well, which could be used together. Well, here it is! There is a big focus is synchronization, since this is a common issue for scripts using ropes. Winch functionality is also included and synchronized.

## Features
- Actions are fully synchronized between players and optimized for performance. You can use the same ropes and vehicles with multiple people.
- Includes winch functionality, press the arrow-up key to toggle this feature when driving a vehicle with a rope attached.
- The script is standalone and has no dependencies, optional job requirements are implemented for esx and qbcore.
- You can add a rope/winch to any vehicle by adding it to the configuration.
- Many other configurable options, like key bindings, labels, notifications and more.
- Usage of animations and props to enhance immersion.
- Works together with our free flatbed script, which can be found on our website as well: https://gamzkystore.com/.
